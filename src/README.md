## Key Design Decisions

### Pixel Art Pipeline
The scene renders to a WebGLRenderTarget at 1/2 screen resolution, then displays on a fullscreen quad with `NearestFilter`. This creates a stylized pixel look without changing any geometry.

### Curved Track via CatmullRom Spline
The track is a `CatmullRomCurve3` with 1000 arc-length subdivisions. Everything — rail segments, ties, ballast, grinder cars, passing trains, scenery — positions itself by querying `getTrackPoint(distance)` which returns position + forward + right + up + banking angle.

### Bogie-Based Car Positioning
Each car computes its orientation from the line between its front and rear bogie positions on the spline. This naturally produces smooth articulation through curves — a long car on a wide curve barely rotates, a short car on a tight curve rotates more.

### Dual Rail Independence
Left and right rails have independent profiles, defects, and controls. Left rail uses Q/E for angle and A/D for pressure; right rail uses U/O for angle and J/L for pressure (mirrored direction so controls match the visual). The right rail's profile display is mirrored so gauge sides face inward.

### InstancedMesh for Scenery and Adjacent Track
Trees, bushes, rocks, grass use `InstancedMesh` to reduce draw calls from ~2000 to ~15. The adjacent passing-train track (rails, ties, ballast, shoulders) also uses `InstancedMesh` — 4 draw calls instead of ~800.

### Track Section Offset
The track has a 50m lead-in zone before game sections begin (`sectionOffset`). This lets the 9-car grinder consist spread out along the track without trailing cars clamping to position 0. `getSectionIndex()` and `getSegmentsForSection()` account for this offset; `getSegmentIndex()` (visual only) does not.

### Pre-allocated Temp Objects
Hot-path methods (`handleGrinderMovement`, `handleInspectionPass`, `getTrackPoint`, `handleCamera`) reuse pre-allocated `Vector3`/`Quaternion`/`Matrix4` objects to avoid per-frame garbage collection pressure.

### Occupancy Grid for Scenery Placement
`Environment` pre-computes a hash-based occupancy grid at construction time so `isOnTrack()` is O(1) instead of sampling 101 spline points per call.

### Procedural Everything
No external files are loaded. Textures are drawn on `<canvas>` elements, audio is synthesized with Web Audio API oscillators and noise buffers, the US map is drawn from coordinate arrays, and all 3D models are built from primitive geometries.

## Adding a New Job

Edit `src/ui/JobSelect.ts` and add an entry to the `JOBS` array:

```typescript
{
  id: 'myroute',
  name: 'My Railroad — Subdivision Name',
  location: 'State',
  description: 'Description of the route and its defects.',
  difficulty: 'Medium',
  difficultyColor: '#ccaa22',
  trackLength: '300m',
  sections: 15,
  defectMultiplier: 0.7,    // 0-1, scales defect severity
  defectSeverity: 0.7,
  timeOfDay: 1,              // 0=dawn, 1=day, 2=dusk, 3=night
  trackPoints: [
    new THREE.Vector3(x, 0, z),  // control points for CatmullRom spline
    // ... more points define the route's curves
  ],
}
```

Add the location to `JOB_LOCATIONS` with real longitude/latitude for the US map marker.

## Performance Notes

- **Target**: 60fps on modern hardware at 1080p
- **Main bottleneck**: `RailSegment.rebuildMesh()` during grinding (ExtrudeGeometry rebuild)
- **Light count**: 7 total (1 directional, 1 hemisphere, 4 work lights, 1 spark light)
- **Draw calls**: ~50-80 (instanced scenery + train geometry + rail segments)
- **Particle count**: 800 sparks + 2000 rain (when active)
